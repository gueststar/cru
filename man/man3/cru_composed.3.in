cru_composed \- edge composing function in the cru library

.SH DESCRIPTION
Some graph algorithms might benefit when an edge into a vertex having
another edge out of it can be replaced by an edge directly from the
origin of the former to the terminus of the latter, in effect
bypassing the vertex. This function creates new edges of that form in
an existing graph
.I g
based on criteria specified in
.I c
initialized by the caller according to the usual
.BR cru_composer
calling conventions. The parameter
.I c
may also be
NULL,
in which case no edges are created.
.\"killsw
In this case, no edges are created and the given graph is reclaimed.
.\"lanes
.P
For purposes of memory management,
.I g
is consumed by
.BR cru_composed
and should not be used subsequently or reclaimed by the caller.
The other parameters are not consumed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful completion, the returned value is a pointer to a graph
derived from
.I g
by modifying it in place. Applications should treat the returned
value as opaque but may pass it as a parameter to other library
functions. In the event of any error, a
NULL
pointer is returned. A
NULL
pointer is also returned if the given parameter
.I g
is
NULL,
which in this case represents an empty graph and is not in itself an
error.
.SH ERRORS
.\"cb_errs
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory to allocate all necessary resources.
.TP
.BR EAGAIN
Resources or permissions are insufficient to create a thread.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADGPH
The parameter
.I g
refers to an invalid or corrupted graph.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADKIL
The parameter
.I k
refers to an invalid or corrupted kill switch structure.
.TP
.BR CRU_INTKIL
The operation was stopped by user intervention using the kill switch
.I k.
.TP
.BR CRU_TPCMPR
The
.BR m_free
and
.BR r_free
fields differ but the
.BR vacuous_case
field is
NULL
in any of
.I c->co_props.local.vertex,
.I c->co_props.local.incident,
.I c->co_props.local.outgoing,
.I c->co_props.adjacent.vertex,
.I c->co_props.adjacent.incident,
or
.I c->co_props.adjacent.outgoing.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDCQO
The field
.I c->labeler.qop
is
NULL
but the graph
.I g
contains dynamically allocated edge labels.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDEQU
The graph
.I g
contains dynamically allocated edge labels but no edge equality
predicate was defined when it was built.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDHSH
The graph
.I g
contains dynamically allocated edge labels but no
edge hash function was defined when it was built.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDRED
A
.BR reduction
field is
NULL
in any one of
.I c->co_props.local.incident,
.I c->co_props.local.outgoing,
.I c->co_props.adjacent.incident,
or
.I c->co_props.adjacent.outgoing
whose other fields are not all
NULL.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDVAC
The
.BR vacuous_case
field is
NULL
in either of
.I c->co_props.local.incident
or
.I c->co_props.adjacent.incident
whose other fields are not all
NULL,
but the graph
.I g
contains a vertex with no incident edges,
or the
.BR vacuous_case
field is
NULL
in either of
.I c->co_props.local.outgoing
or
.I c->co_props.adjacent.outgoing
whose other fields are not all
NULL,
but the graph
.I g
contains a vertex with no outgoing edges.
