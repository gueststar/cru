.SH DESCRIPTION
This function creates new vertices in a graph
.I g
located along the edges between existing vertices according to
user-defined criteria set by
.I s
following the usual
.BR cru_stretcher
calling conventions. Alternatively, a NULL value of
.I s
is allowed and causes the graph to be returned unmodified.
.\"killsw
In this case, the whole graph is reclaimed.
.\"lanes
.P
For purposes of memory management,
the graph
.I g
is consumed and should not be accessed or reclaimed afterwards.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful completion, the returned value is a pointer to a graph
derived from
.I g
with additional vertices and edges modified as directed by the given
.BR cru_stretcher
structure
.I s.
Applications should treat the returned value as opaque but may pass it
as a parameter to other library functions. In the event of any error,
a NULL
pointer is returned. A
NULL
pointer is also returned if the given parameter
.I g
is
NULL,
which in this case represents an empty graph and is not in itself an
error.
.SH ERRORS
.\"cb_errs
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory to allocate all necessary resources.
.TP
.BR EAGAIN
Resources or permissions are insufficient to create a thread.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADGPH
The parameter
.I g
refers to an invalid or corrupted graph.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADKIL
The parameter
.I k
refers to an invalid or corrupted kill switch structure.
.TP
.BR CRU_INTKIL
The operation was stopped by user intervention using the kill switch
.I k.
.TP
.BR CRU_INTOVF
A number of vertices was created approaching or exceeding a limit
previously associated with the graph
.I g.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDEXP
The field
.I s->expander
is NULL.
.TP
.BR CRU_TPCMPR
The
.BR m_free
and
.BR r_free
fields differ
where the
.BR vacuous_case
field is
NULL
in either of the
.I s->st_prop.incident
or
.I s->st_prop.outgoing
structures.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDMAP
The
.BR map
field in either of
.I s->st_prop.incident
or
.I s->st_prop.outgoing
is
NULL
but at least one other field in it is not
NULL.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDRED
The
.BR reduction
field is
NULL
in either of
.I s->st_prop.incident
or
.I s->st_prop.outgoing
whose other fields are not all
NULL.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDVAC
The
.I s->st_prop.incident.vacuous_case
field is
NULL,
at least one other field of
.I s->st_prop.incident
is not
NULL, and there is a vertex in the graph
.I g
with no incoming edges,
or the
.I s->st_prop.outgoing.vacuous_case
field is
NULL, at least one other field of
.I s->st_prop.outgoing
is not NULL, and there is a vertex in the graph with no outgoing
edges.
