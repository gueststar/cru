.TH CRU_FREE_LATER 3 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_free_later \- non-blocking graph reclamation function
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
void
.BR cru_free_later
(
.BR cru_graph
.I g
,
int *
.I err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function reclaims all memory allocated for storage of a graph and
does so in a single background thread so that it can return
immediately without blocking the caller. The parameter
.I g
refers to the graph to be reclaimed, and is expected to have been
returned by some library function that returns a
.BR cru_graph.
.P
For purposes of memory management, the graph
.I g
is consumed by this function and must not be accessed afterwards.
.SH RETURN VALUE
none
.SH ERRORS
To avoid a memory leak, this function must be called for each
graph before it goes out of scope. Memory leaks are an error but
are not detected or reported.
.P
Any attempted use of the graph
.I g
subsequent to passing it to this function is
an error with unpredictable consequences.
.P
.\"errs
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory to start a thread, so
the graph was freed sequentially in the foreground.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADGPH
The parameter
.I g
refers to a corrupted or invalid
.BR cru_graph.
.SH NOTES
This way of freeing a graph is appropriate if the application performs
further operations after using the graph that are insufficiently
memory intensive to warrant freeing it in advance, and are
sufficiently time consuming in themselves to ensure adequate time for
the reclamation to complete single-threaded in the background without
blocking the job's termination. The alternative of
.BR cru_free_now
is more appropriate otherwise.
