.SH NAME
cru_connect \- connect a new edge and a new vertex to a graph
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
void
.BR cru_connect
(
.br
.BR cru_edge
.I label
,
.br
.BR cru_vertex
.I terminus
,

int *
.I err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function creates an edge labeled by the given argument
.I label
and terminating at a vertex given by
.I terminus
in a graph that is being built or spread. The
.BR cru_edge
and
.BR cru_vertex
types are aliases for
.I void
pointers that can be cast from any compatible types specific to the
application. If they are pointers to dynamically allocated storage,
then the caller must allocate and initialize the storage before
calling
.BR cru_connect.
The caller must detect and prevent dangling pointers from being
passed.
.P
This function is meant to be called only by a user-defined
.BR cru_connector
or
.BR cru_subconnector
callback function referenced respectively by the
.BR connector
or
.BR subconnector
field of a
.BR cru_builder
structure.
.TP
*
The originating vertex of
the edge to be created is not passed to
.BR cru_connect
because it is determined implicitly by the
.BR cru_vertex
argument to the callback function.
.TP
*
The
.BR cru_vertex
passed to
.BR cru_connect
is passed as the originating vertex in a subsequent invocation of the
callback function.
.SH RETURN VALUE
none
.SH ERRORS
.\"errs
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory to allocate all necessary resources.
.TP
.BR CRU_INTOOC
The function was called outside the context of callback function referenced
through a
.BR cru_builder.
