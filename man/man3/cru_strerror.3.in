.TH CRU_STRERROR 3 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_strerror \- translate an error code to a readable message
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
char *
.BR cru_strerror
(
int
.I err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Given an integer error code
set by some other
.BR cru
library function, this function translates it to a terse readable
message similarly to the POSIX standard
.BR strerror
function. POSIX error codes, error codes originating from the
.BR nthm
library, and codes specific to
.BR cru
are detected and the results are formatted accordingly. The latter
include test failure codes, internal error codes, and those listed
below. Any other error codes are reported as undiagnosed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The returned value is a statically allocated zero-terminated ASCII
string that may be printed but should not be modified or freed. The
following specific error codes are translated as shown.
@ERROR_LIST@
.SH NOTES
This function is not thread-safe and not meant for production code unless
its use is restricted to a single thread context.
.P
Error codes of the form
.BR CRU_DEVXXX
are for development use involving custom builds and are not otherwise
documented.
.P
Return values of the form
.nf
   nthm-X.Y.Z: internal error code nnn
   cru-X.Y.Z: internal error code nnn
.fi
where "X.Y.Z" is a version number and "nnn" is a decimal internal
error code number are indicative of possible bugs in these libraries
worthy of a bug report including a reproducible test case.
