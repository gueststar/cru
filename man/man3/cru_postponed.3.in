.SH DESCRIPTION
This function transplants selected edges in a graph
.I g
to the termini of their sibling edges according to
user-defined criteria set by
.I p
following the usual
.BR cru_postponer
calling conventions. Alternatively, a NULL value of
.I s
is allowed and causes the graph to be returned unmodified.
.\"killsw
In this case, the whole graph is reclaimed.
.\"lanes
.P
For purposes of memory management,
the graph
.I g
is consumed and should not be accessed or reclaimed afterwards.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful completion, the returned value is a pointer to a graph
derived from
.I g
selected edges transplanted as directed by the given
.BR cru_postponer
structure
.I p.
Applications should treat the returned value as opaque but may pass it
as a parameter to other library functions. In the event of any error,
a NULL
pointer is returned. A
NULL
pointer is also returned if the given parameter
.I g
is
NULL,
which in this case represents an empty graph and is not in itself an
error.
.SH ERRORS
.\"cb_errs
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory to allocate all necessary resources.
.TP
.BR EAGAIN
Resources or permissions are insufficient to create a thread.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADGPH
The parameter
.I g
refers to an invalid or corrupted graph.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADKIL
The parameter
.I k
refers to an invalid or corrupted kill switch structure.
.TP
.BR CRU_INTKIL
The operation was stopped by user intervention using the kill switch
.I k.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDPOP
The field
.I p->postponable
is NULL.
