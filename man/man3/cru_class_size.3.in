.TH CRU_CLASS_SIZE 3 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_class_size \- get the cardinality of a class in a partitioned graph
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
uintptr_t
.BR cru_class_size
(
.BR cru_class
.I c
,
int *
.I err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is part of a simple and efficient API for manipulating
sets of vertices. The parameter
.I c
models a class in a partition on the vertices in a graph. A partition
is a set of classes such that each vertex belongs to exactly one
class. The parameter
.I c
is expected to have been obtained from a prior invocation of
.BR cru_class_of.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful completion, this function returns the number of vertices
belonging to the class represented by
.I c,
which is always greater than zero.
.SH ERRORS
.\"errs
.TP
.BR CRU_BADCLS
The parameter
.I c
refers to a corrupted or invalid
.BR cru_class.
.TP
.BR CRU_NULCLS
The parameter
.I c
is a
NULL
pointer, hence not a valid class.
.SH NOTES
This function is a very fast constant time operation. Invoking it
repeatedly may be no less efficient than storing and retrieving its
past results.
