.SH DESCRIPTION
This function identifies each vertex in a graph
.I g
with a class of equivalent vertices and transforms each class into a
single vertex according to user-defined criteria set by
.I c
following the usual
.BR cru_merger
calling conventions.
Alternatively, a NULL value of
.I c
is allowed and causes the graph to be returned unmodified.
.\"killsw
In this case, the whole graph is reclaimed.
.\"lanes
.P
For purposes of memory management,
the graph
.I g
is consumed and should not be accessed or reclaimed afterwards.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful completion, the returned value is a pointer to a graph
derived from
.I g
collecting the vertices and edges into classes as specified by the
given
.BR cru_merger
structure
.I c.
Applications should treat the returned value as opaque but may pass it
as a parameter to other library functions. In the event of any error,
a NULL
pointer is returned. A
NULL
pointer is also returned if the given parameter
.I g
is
NULL,
which in this case represents an empty graph and is not in itself an
error.
.SH ERRORS
.\"cb_errs
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory to allocate all necessary resources.
.TP
.BR EAGAIN
Resources or permissions are insufficient to create a thread.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADGPH
The parameter
.I g
refers to an invalid or corrupted graph.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADKIL
The parameter
.I k
refers to an invalid or corrupted kill switch structure.
.TP
.BR CRU_INTKIL
The operation was stopped by user intervention using the kill switch
.I k.
.TP
.BR CRU_INCMRG
A consistency check failed on the
.BR cru_merger
.I c,
specifically that one of
.I c->me_classifier
and
.I c->me_kernel.v_op
is initialized but not the other.
.TP
.BR CRU_TPCMPR
The
.BR m_free
and
.BR r_free
fields differ
where the
.BR vacuous_case
field is
NULL
in any of the
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.incident,
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.outgoing,
or
.I c->me_kernel.e_op
structures.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDMAP
The
.BR map
field in any of
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.incident,
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.outgoing,
or
.I c->me_kernel.e_op
is
NULL
but at least one other field in it is not
NULL.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDRED
The field
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.reduction
is NULL, or the
.BR reduction
field is
NULL
in either of
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.incident
or
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.outgoing
whose other fields are not all
NULL.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDVAC
The
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.incident.vacuous_case
field is
NULL,
at least one other field of
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.incident
is not
NULL, and there is a vertex in the graph
.I g
with no incoming edges,
or the
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.outgoing.vacuous_case
field is
NULL, at least one other field of
.I c->me_kernel.v_op.outgoing
is not NULL, and there is a vertex in the graph with no outgoing
edges.
