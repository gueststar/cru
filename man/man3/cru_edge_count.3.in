.TH CRU_EDGE_COUNT 3 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_edge_count \- compute the number of edges in a graph
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
uintptr_t
.BR cru_edge_count
(
.br
.BR cru_graph
.I g
,
.br
unsigned
.I lanes

int *
.I err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function calculates the number of edges in a graph
.I g
by visiting each vertex and adding the number of its outgoing edges
to the total.
.\"lanes
.P
For memory management purposes, no parameters are consumed or
modified.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful completion, the function returns
the number of edges in the graph
.I g.
It might return zero in the event of an error or if the graph has no
edges, which is not in itself an error, or it might return the
correct value even in the event of an error by resorting to an
alternative algorithm. It is reasonable to assume any non-zero value
returned is correct.
.SH ERRORS
.\"errs
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory to allocate all necessary resources.
.TP
.BR EAGAIN
Resources or permissions are insufficient to acquire a lock.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADGPH
The parameter
.I g
refers to an invalid or corrupted graph.
.SH NOTES
This calculation could also be done using the
.BR cru_mapreduced
function, but is faster this way.
.P
Misleading results are possible if
the graph is in need of deduplication by the
.BR cru_deduplicated
function.
