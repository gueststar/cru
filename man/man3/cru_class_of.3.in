.TH CRU_CLASS_OF 3 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_class_of \- get a vertex's class in a partitioned graph
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
.BR cru_class
.BR cru_class_of
(
.BR cru_partition
.I p
,
.BR cru_vertex
.I x
,
int *
.I err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is part of a simple and efficient API for manipulating
sets of vertices. The parameter
.I p
models a partition on the vertices in a graph, which is a set of
classes such that each vertex belongs to exactly one class. The
partition is expected to have been obtained from a prior invocation of
.BR cru_partition_of.
The other parameter
.I x
is expected to be a vertex in the graph previously used to obtain the
partition.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful completion, this function returns
a representation of the class containing the vertex
.I x
as a
.BR cru_class.
The return value is a pointer to an opaque type, but applications can
rely on the condition that any two vertices belong to the same
whenever the results obtained for them by this function are equal, and
only then. Although the return value is a pointer, the application
must not attempt to free it.
.SH ERRORS
.\"cb_errs
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory to allocate all necessary resources.
.TP
.BR EAGAIN
Resources or permissions are insufficient to acquire a lock.
.TP
.BR CRU_BADPRT
The parameter
.I p
refers to a corrupted or invalid
.BR cru_partition.
.TP
.BR CRU_PARVNF
The parameter
.I x
refers to something other than a vertex in the graph
partitioned by
.I p.
