.SH DESCRIPTION
This function installs edges labeled
.I label_in
and
.I label_out
made to terminate and to originate respectively at a
vertex given by
.I new_vertex
into a graph being stretched by the
.BR cru_stretched
library function. The
.BR cru_edge
and
.BR cru_vertex
types are aliases for
.I void
pointers that can be cast from any compatible types specific to the
application. If they are pointers to dynamically allocated storage,
then the caller must allocate and initialize the storage before
calling
.BR cru_connect.
The caller must detect and prevent dangling pointers from being
passed.
.P
This function is meant to be called only by a user-defined
.BR cru_tpred
callback function referenced by the
.BR expander
field of a
.BR cru_stretcher
structure passed to
.BR cru_stretched.
The edges and the vertex are installed in the graph parallel to the
edge passed to the callback function, with the edge labeled by
.I label_in
originating from the edge's origin and the edge labeled by
.I label_out
terminating at the edge's terminus.
.SH RETURN VALUE
none
.SH ERRORS
.\"errs
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory to allocate all necessary resources.
.TP
.BR CRU_INTOOC
The function was called outside the context of callback function referenced
through a
.BR cru_stretcher.
