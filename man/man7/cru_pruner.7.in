.TH CRU_PRUNER 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_pruner \- context dependent edge filter used by the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef int (*
.BR cru_pruner
)(int,
.BR cru_edge,
int *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
A user-defined function cast to this type effects optional selective
deletion or "filtering" of graph edges in the course of a merging
operation performed by the
.BR cru_merged
API function.
For each equivalence class of vertices to be merged and for each
outgoing edge label observed in the class,
.BR cru
calls the pruner function passing it a condition flag, the edge label,
and a pointer to an initially zero error code. The
.BR cru_edge
type is an alias for a
.I void
pointer, to which any pointer-sized type can be cast by the
application developer. The condition flag is non-zero if and only if
every vertex in the class has at least one outgoing edge labeled by
the given label.
.P
Pruner functions should treat the edge label as read-only, but may
assign the error code.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If a pruner returns any non-zero value, the graph is unaffected.
.P
If a pruner returns zero, all outgoing edges labeled by the given
label are deleted from all vertices in the equivalence class for
which the pruner is called.
.SH ERRORS
If a pruner sets the error code to any non-zero value,
the
.BR cru_merge
operation in progress when it is called reclaims the graph passed to it,
returns an empty graph, and propagates the same error code to its
caller.
.P
Applications can report POSIX error codes or define special purpose
codes, but should not redefine any that clash with those
reserved by
.BR cru
as declared in the
.I error_codes.h
header file.
.SH NOTES
The intended use case for this feature pertains to an unusual Petri
net reachability graph transformation. For filtering of edges by criteria
independent of their relationship to other class members, the
.BR cru_filtered
function is a better alternative.
.P
Pruner functions are passed to
.BR cru
via the
.BR pruner
field of a
.BR cru_merger
structure passed to the
.BR cru_merged
library function. This field may be omitted or assigned
NULL
if the pruning step is not required.
