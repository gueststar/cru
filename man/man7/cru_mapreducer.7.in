cru_mapreducer \- parallel graph metric computation specification
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_mapreducer_s
.br
{

.BR cru_zone_s
.BR ma_zone;

.BR cru_mapreducer;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This structure parameterizes the
.BR cru_mapreduced
library function with necessary information initialized by the
application to compute an arbitrary user-defined metric
about a graph. The metric is computed according to the usual
calling conventions for a
.BR cru_prop
as given by the
.BR ma_prop
field. The computation can pertain to a section of the graph
restricted by the
.BR cru_zone
structure in the
.BR ma_zone
field. Alternatively, the
.BR ma_zone
field may be omitted or zero-filled, in which case the whole graph is
used.
.P
Unlike an induction, all vertices are visited effectively in parallel
in the course of this operation. The value derived from each vertex
can depend on its adjacent vertices in either direction but not on the
values derived from its adjacent vertices.
.SH NOTES
The reduction phase proceeds under the assumption of a commutative and
associative user-defined vertex reduction operator. Non-deterministic
results are possible if this condition is not met but
.BR cru
has no way of enforcing it.
