.SH NAME
cru_classifier \- equivalence class specification for the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_classifier_s
.br
{
.br
struct
.BR cru_prop_s
.BR cl_prop;
.br
struct
.BR cru_order_s
.BR cl_order;
.br
} *
.BR cru_classifier;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This structure parameterizes the
.BR cru_partition_of
library function with necessary information initialized by the
application to compute a partition on the vertices in a graph,
and is also a field in the
.BR cru_merger
structure used to parameterize the
.BR cru_merged
library function.
.P
For every vertex in a given graph, a property
specified by the
.BR cl_prop
field is computed by the usual
.BR cru_prop
calling conventions. Any two vertices whose properties are equal
according to the
.BR cl_order
field with usual
.BR cru_order
calling conventions are deemed to be members of the same equivalence
class.
.P
Some default values can be inferred automatically.
.TP
*
When the
.BR cru_classifier
is used as a top level structure to parameterize the
.BR cru_partition_of
function,
the vertex reduction in the
.BR cl_prop.vertex.reduction
field is not used and may be omitted or initialized as
NULL.
.TP
*
If the whole
.BR cl_prop
field is omitted or zero-filled, then the property associated with each vertex
is identical to the vertex.
.TP
*
If the vertex fold in the
.BR cl_prop.vertex
has an omitted or
NULL
map destructor
.BR cl_prop.vertex.m_free
and the
.BR cl_order
field is omitted or zero-filled, then a default scalar ordering is
inferred for purposes of comparison.
.P
As these defaults imply, a zero-filled classifier describes the
partition of every vertex in a class by itself.
.SH ERRORS
The predicate in the
.BR cl_order
field must be algebraically reflexive, transitive, and symmetric.
Not meeting this requirement is an error.
There is no way of automatically detecting or enforcing the
error, but anomalous results are likely to follow.
