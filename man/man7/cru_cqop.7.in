.SH NAME
cru_cqop \- conditional quarternary operator for the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_cqop_s
.br
{
.br
.BR cru_qpred
.BR qpred;
.br
.BR cru_qop
.BR qop;
.br
} *
.BR cru_cqop;
.SH DESCRIPTION
A conditional ternary operator represents a quarternary operator whose
result is required only if some predicate is true of its operands.
When conditional operators are passed to
.BR cru
library functions, they are used only as follows:
.TP
*
First the predicate is applied to the operands.
.TP
*
If the predicate returns any non-zero value, then a result is
obtained from the operator applied to those same operands.
.TP
*
If the predicate returns zero, the operator is not invoked and
therefore not required to produce any valid result.
.P
A
NULL
.BR qpred
field causes the operator to be invoked unconditionally. When
operating on a graph created with scalar edge labels,
.BR cru
infers a quartenary operator that unconditionally returns its third
argument if none is specified. That is, if applied to the quadruple of
operands
.I (w,x,y,z)
in that order, the inferred quartenary operator returns
.I y.
.SH ERRORS
Except as noted above, there is no default value for the
.BR qop
field, which must be initialized to something other than
NULL.
Otherwise, an error of
.BR CRU_UNDCQO
is reported for an undefined conditional quartenary operator.
.SH NOTES
Conditional quarternary operands are the
.BR labeler
field in a
.BR cru_composer
structure used during composition operations. The first two operands
are properties of a local and an adjacent vertex, respectively,
computed according to the
.BR co_props
field of the same composer. The other two operands are the label of an
edge from the local vertex and one from the adjacent vertex. The
predicate decides whether to create a new edge, and the operator
determines its label. The default operator creates an edge with the
same label as the outgoing edge from the local vertex, but only if the
edge labels are of scalar types and not dynamically allocated.
