.TH CRU_CBOP 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_cbop \- conditional binary operator for the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_cbop_s
.br
{
.br
.BR cru_bpred
.BR bpred;
.br
.BR cru_bop
.BR bop;
.br
} *
.BR cru_cbop;
.SH DESCRIPTION
A conditional binary operator represents a binary operator whose
result is required only if some predicate is true of its operands.
When conditional operators are passed to
.BR cru
library functions, they are used only as follows:
.TP
*
First the predicate is applied to the operands.
.TP
*
If the predicate returns any non-zero value, then a result is
obtained from the operator applied to those same operands.
.TP
*
If the predicate returns zero, the operator is not invoked and
therefore not required to produce any valid result.
.P
A
NULL
.BR bpred
field causes the operator to be invoked unconditionally.
.SH ERRORS
The
.BR bop
field has no default value and must be initialized to something
other than
NULL.
Otherwise, an error of
.BR CRU_UNDCBO
is reported for an undefined conditional binary operator.
.SH NOTES
Conditional binary operators appear in the
.BR postponement
field of a
.BR cru_postponer
and in the
.BR e_prod
field of a
.BR cru_crosser.
In both cases the operands are a pair of edge labels and the result
returned by the operator is the label of a newly created or modified
edge.
