.TH CRU_TOP 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_top \- ternary operator function type used in the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef void* (*
.BR cru_top
)(void *, void *, void *, int *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
A user-defined ternary operator takes three operands and a pointer
to an initially zero error code as arguments. The operands can be
scalar values, pointers to heap allocated storage, or a combination.
The operator must treat the operands as read only but may assign the
error code.
.P
Applications use ternary operators to tell
.BR cru
API functions how to compute some value determined by a vertex or
an edge and its immediate environment.
.TP
*
In some contexts, the middle operand is an edge label and the first
and last operands are the vertices or user-defined properties of the
vertices at either end of the edge.
.TP
*
In other contexts, the middle operand is a vertex and the first and
last operands are user-defined values computed by reductions over the
set of its incoming edges and the set of its outgoing edges
respectively.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value may be either a scalar value or a pointer to the heap
at the option of the application developer. In the case of a pointer,
the result ordinarily refers to newly allocated storage. However,
applications may opt to return a pointer to shared storage provided
the operator and the corresponding
.BR cru_destructor
function implement thread-safe reference
counting.
.SH ERRORS
If a ternary operator sets the error code to any non-zero value, the
.BR cru
API function invoking it terminates early without completing, and
propagates the same error code to its caller.
.P
Applications can report POSIX error codes or define special purpose
codes, but should not redefine any that clash with those
reserved by
.BR cru
as declared in the
.I error_codes.h
header file.
.SH NOTES
Ternary operators are passed to
.BR cru
API functions not directly but by pointers to them in the fields of
base structures built into derived structures then built into the top
level structures that are passed via the API. One such field
is the
.BR map
in a
.BR cru_fold
structure and the other is
.BR top
field of a
.BR cru_ctop
(conditional ternary operator)
structure.
Regarding the operand interpretations mentioned above,
the middle operand is a vertex only when the operator
is the
.BR map
field of a
.BR cru_fold
used as the
.BR vertex
field of a
.BR cru_prop.
In any other context, it is an edge label.
