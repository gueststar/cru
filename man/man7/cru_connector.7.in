.TH CRU_CONNECTOR 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_connector \- simple graph production rule used by the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef void (*
.BR cru_connector
)
(
.br
.BR cru_vertex
,
.br
int *
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
A user-defined function cast to this type takes a vertex belonging to
a graph under construction and a pointer to an initially zero integer
error code as arguments. The
.BR cru_vertex
type is an alias for a
.I void
pointer, which may refer to any type chosen by the application
developer. The function must treat the vertex as read-only but may
assign the error code.
.P
The function is expected to call
.BR cru_connect
exactly once for each outgoing edge from the given vertex, creating
and passing an edge label and an adjacent vertex to
.BR cru_connect
on each call.
In so doing, the function incrementally builds the graph by requesting
inclusion of the newly created adjacent vertex and edge.
.P
Adjacent vertices created in this way are passed in subsequent calls
to the same connector function unless they have been created
previously. If multiple worker threads attempt to create the same
adjacent vertex (due to it being reachable through multiple paths)
only one call to the connector function is ever made for it and
redundant copies of the vertex are automatically reclaimed if a
destructor is provided for them.
.SH ERRORS
If a connector function sets the error code to any non-zero value,
the instance of
.BR cru_built
that calls it terminates without building a graph and
propagates the same error code to its caller.
.P
Applications can report POSIX error codes or define special purpose
codes, but should not redefine any that clash with those
reserved by
.BR cru
as declared in the
.I error_codes.h
header file.
.SH NOTES
Connector functions are
referenced by the
.BR connector
field in a
.BR cru_builder
structure passed to the
.BR cru_built
library function. This field has no default value.
