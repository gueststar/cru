.TH CRU_CTOP_PAIR 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_ctop_pair \- pair of conditional ternary operators
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_ctop_pair_s
.br
{
.br
struct
.BR cru_ctop_s
.BR ana_labeler;
.br
struct
.BR cru_ctop_s
.BR cata_labeler;
.br
} *
.BR cru_ctop_pair;
.SH DESCRIPTION
Applications initialize this structure for use by the
.BR cru_split
library function as a way of specifying the edge labels in a graph to
correspond with vertices it creates. There is one conditional ternary
operator for each member of a pair of vertices derived from a common
vertex.
.P
For each edge connected to a created vertex, the corresponding ternary
predicate
.BR ana_labeler.tpred
or
.BR cata_labeler.tpred
is passed an edge label as its middle operand and the properties of
the edge's origin and terminus respectively as its left and right
operands. Per usual
.BR cru_ctop
calling conventions, if the predicate returns a non-zero value, then
the operator
.BR ana_labeler.top
or
.BR cata_labeler.top
is called with the same operands to produce a replacement
for the given edge label. If the predicate returns zero, then the
given edge is deleted.
.P
For splitting a graph whose edge labels are scalar values, either or
both fields can be omitted or zero-filled. In that case, a copy
of the given edge is made unconditionally.
.SH NOTES
The
.BR cru_ctop_pair
structure is a field in the
.BR cru_ctop_quad
structure, which is part of the
.BR cru_splitter
top level structure. Whether the created vertex is the origin or the terminus
of the edge whose label is passed to the operator depends on whether it is
an incoming or an outgoing edge from the created vertex, which depends on
whether the
.BR cru_ctop_pair
structure is in the
.BR inward
or the
.BR outward
field of the
.BR cru_ctop_quad
structure.
