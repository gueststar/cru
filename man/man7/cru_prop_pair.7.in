.TH CRU_PROP_PAIR 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_prop_pair \- a pair of vertex property specifications
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_prop_pair_s
.br
{
.br
struct
.BR cru_prop_s
.BR local;
.br
struct
.BR cru_prop_s
.BR adjacent;
.br
} *
.BR cru_prop_pair;
.SH DESCRIPTION
Applications can initialize two
.BR cru_prop
structures as fields in this structure to be used jointly for
evaluating vertex properties in the course of composition operations
performed by the
.BR cru_composed
library function. Each vertex can have two properties, one given by
each field, and each property is allowed to depend on the vertex, its
edges, and its adjacent vertices in either direction according to the
usual calling conventions for
.BR cru_prop
structures.
.P
When a pair of end-to-end edges is under consideration for the
creation of a new edge representing their composition, the local
vertex property of the originating vertex and the adjacent property of
the intermediate vertex inform the result.
.P
Either or both of these fields can be omitted or filled with zeros.
If so, the corresponding property defaults to a verbatim copy of the
vertex.
.SH NOTES
The
.BR cru_prop_pair
structure is a field in the
.BR cru_composer
top level structure. The property values are passed as parameters to the
quartenary operator and predicate in the
.BR labeler
field of the same structure.
