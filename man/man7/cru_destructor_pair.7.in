.TH CRU_DESTRUCTOR_PAIR 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_destructor_pair \- graph reclamation specification
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_destructor_pair_s
.br
{
.br
.BR cru_destructor
.BR v_free;
.br
.BR cru_destructor
.BR e_free;
.br
} *
.BR cru_destructor_pair;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This structure encapsulates the information needed for reclaiming or
releasing the memory used by a graph. Large graphs might use
considerable memory, so reclaiming them is important when they are no
longer needed and the memory is needed for other purposes.
.P
Because the edge labels and the vertices in a graph may be of
different types dependent on the application, two seperate
user-defined destructor functions can be specified. The
.BR v_free
field is for the vertex destructor,
and the
.BR e_free
field is for the edge label destructor.
.P
Applications have the option of initializing either or both of these
fields as pointers to functions, or of making either or both fields
NULL.
Any functions referenced must follow the usual calling conventions for
.BR cru_destructor
functions.
.P
A
NULL
value assigned to either of these fields at the time a graph is built
tells
.BR cru
that the corresponding vertices or edge labels in the graph are scalar
values rather than pointers, hence never in need of reclamation. This
condition may enable other inferences, such as the use of default
equality relations and hash functions.
.SH ERRORS
It is an error to omit the destructors for dynamically allocated
vertices or edges because doing so causes memory leaks and possibly
other anomalies. There is no way for
.BR cru
to detect this error.
.SH NOTES
The
.BR cru_destructor_pair
structure is part of the
.BR cru_sig
structure, which is part of the
.BR cru_builder,
.BR cru_fabricator,
and
.BR cru_crosser
top level structures. Inferences about relations and hash functions
based on the lack of a corresponding destructor apply to the
.BR cru_order
in the same
.BR cru_sig.
