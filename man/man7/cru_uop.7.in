.TH CRU_UOP 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_uop \- unary operator function type used in the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef void* (*
.BR cru_uop
)(void *, int *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
A user-defined unary operator takes a single operand and a pointer to
an initially zero error code as arguments. Unary operators serve
various purposes, but the operand invariably represents either a
vertex or an edge label in a graph. It can be either a scalar value or
a pointer to heap allocated storage. The operator must treat the operand
as read only but may assign the error code.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value represents an edge label or a vertex in a graph
depending on the context, and may be either a scalar value or a
pointer to the heap depending on how the application developer chooses
to represent them. In the case of a pointer, the result ordinarily
refers to newly allocated storage. However, applications may opt to
return a pointer to shared storage provided the operator and the
corresponding
.BR cru_destructor
function implement thread-safe reference
counting.
.SH ERRORS
If a unary operator sets the error code to any non-zero value, the
.BR cru
API function invoking it terminates early without completing, and
propagates the same error code to its caller.
.P
Applications can report POSIX error codes or define special purpose
codes, but should not redefine any that clash with those
reserved by
.BR cru
as declared in the
.I error_codes.h
header file.
.SH NOTES
Applications pass unary operators to
.BR cru
through the
.BR v_fab
and
.BR e_fab
fields of a
.BR cru_fabricator,
which are passed to the
.BR cru_fabricated
library function.
