.SH NAME
cru_plan \- specification of a graph traversal strategy
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_plan_s
.br
{
.br
int
.BR local_first;
.br
int
.BR remote_first;
.br
struct
.BR cru_zone_s
.BR zone;
.br
} *
.BR cru_plan;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This structure specifies a selected region of some existing graph and
a traversal priority through that region as instructions to
.BR cru
library functions for mutating the graph. Only the selected region is
visited, and the vertices in it are visited only in the requested
order.
.P
The region of the graph to be visited is specified by the
.BR zone
field and the traversal priority is indicated by the integer
fields. If the zone is omitted or filled with zeros, then the whole
graph is visited. At most one of the integer fields may be non-zero.
.TP
*
If
.BR local_first
is non-zero, then the initial vertex is visited first.
.TP
*
If
.BR remote_first
is non-zero, then the initial vertex is visited last.
.TP
*
If both integer fields are zero, then the vertices are visited in a
non-deterministic order conducive to best concurrency. For cyclic
graphs, only this choice is valid.
.P
The requested traversal priority, if any, further constrains each vertex
to be visited only after its adjacent prerequisites are visited. The
prerequisites depend on both the traversal priority and the zone orientation,
which is backwards if the
.BR backwards
field in the zone is non-zero, and forward otherwise. A backwards
oriented zone consists of all vertices from which the initial vertex
is reachable, whereas a forward oriented zone consists of all vertices
reachable from the initial vertex.
.TP
*
If the priority is
.BR local_first
and the zone orientation is forward, then the prerequisites of each vertex are
the origins within the zone of its incoming edges.
.TP
*
If the priority is
.BR remote_first
and the zone orientation is forward, then the prerequisites of each vertex are
all termini of its outgoing edges.
.TP
*
If the priority is
.BR local_first
and the zone orientation is backwards, then the prerequisites of each vertex are
the termini within the zone of its outgoing edges.
.TP
*
If the priority is
.BR remote_first
and the zone orientation is backwards, then the prerequisites of each vertex are
all origins of its incoming edges.
.SH ERRORS
Error codes are reported when this structure is passed to the
.BR cru_mutated
function with invalid settings under the following circumstances.
.TP
.BR CRU_INCTRP
Both traversal priorities are requested.
.TP
.BR CRU_INCINV
The zone offset is non-zero but its initial vertex is not in the graph.
.TP
.BR CRU_TPCMUT
The mutation changes the destructors but the zone does not cover the whole graph.
.SH NOTES
Vertices in backwards oriented zones may have outgoing edges to
vertices outside the zone, and vertices in forward oriented zones may
have incoming edges from vertices outside the zone. Vertices outside
of a zone are not prerequisites but are visible nevertheless to the
kernel operators during a mutation.
.P
A
.BR cru_plan
structure is a field in the
.BR cru_mutator
top level structure parameterizing the
.BR cru_mutated
function. Omitting or filling the
.BR mu_plan
field with zeros is valid.
