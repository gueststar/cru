.TH CRU_BOP 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_bop \- binary operator function type used in the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef void* (*
.BR cru_bop
)(void *, void *, int *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
A user-defined binary operator takes a pair of operands and a pointer
to an initially zero error code as arguments. The operands can be
scalar values, pointers to heap allocated storage, or a combination.
The operator must treat the operands as read only but may assign the
error code.
.P
Binary operators serve various purposes, such as constructing a new
vertex from a pair of vertices, a new edge label from a pair of edge
labels, or constructing more general results when used as the
.BR reduction
operator in a
.BR cru_fold
structure. See the NOTES section below for details.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value may be either a scalar value or a pointer to the heap
depending on the application's representation for it. In the case of a
pointer, the result ordinarily refers to newly allocated
storage. However, applications may opt to return a pointer to shared
storage provided the operator and the corresponding
.BR cru_destructor
function implement thread-safe reference
counting.
.SH ERRORS
If a binary operator sets the error code to any non-zero value, the
.BR cru
API function invoking it terminates early without completing, and
propagates the same error code to its caller.
.P
Applications can report POSIX error codes or define special purpose
codes, but should not redefine any that clash with those
reserved by
.BR cru
as declared in the
.I error_codes.h
header file.
.SH NOTES
Applications pass binary operators to
.BR cru
as pointers through
.TP
*
the
.BR bop
field in a
.BR cru_cbop
(conditional binary operator) structure, where it returns an
edge label as a result given a pair of edge labels
.TP
*
the
.BR ana
and
.BR cata
fields of a
.BR cru_splitter
structure,
where it returns a vertex given a
vertex and a vertex property
.TP
*
the
.BR cru_vprod
field in a
.BR cru_crosser
structure, where it returns a vertex given a pair of vertices
.TP
*
and the
.BR reduction
field in a
.BR cru_fold
where its result can represent any property or metric about a graph.
.P
Conditional binary operators are used as the
.BR postponement
field in a
.BR cru_postponer
and the
.BR e_prod
field in a
.BR cru_crosser,
which are passed respectively to the
.BR cru_postponed
and
.BR cru_crossed
API functions.
