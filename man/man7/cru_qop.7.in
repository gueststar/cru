.TH CRU_QOP 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_qop \- quaternary operator function type used in the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef void* (*
.BR cru_qop
)(void *, void *, void *, void *, int *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
A user-defined quaternary operator constructs the labels of newly
created edges during composition operations performed by the
.BR cru_composed
API function, which connects a vertex to those that are adjacent to
its adjacent vertices. The quartenary operator is called once for
every combination of pairs of end-to-end edges in the graph passed to
.BR cru_composed.
The label constructed during an invocation can depend in
general on
.TP
*
a user-defined property of the local vertex
.TP
*
a user-defined property of an adjacent vertex
.TP
*
the label of an edge originating from the local vertex
.TP
*
the label of an edge originating from the adjacent vertex.
.P
The four operands to the quarternary operator correspond to these
entities in this order, and can be scalar values, pointers to heap
allocated storage, or a combination depending on the application's way
of representing a graph and its properties. The last parameter is a
pointer to an error code initially zero on entry. The operator must
treat the operands as read only but may assign the error code.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value is expected to be the label for a new edge to be
created in the graph. The new edge connects the vertex whose property
is given in the first operand to the terminus of the edge whose label
is given in the last operand.
.P
The created edge label must be of the same type as the input edge
labels. If the result is a pointer to the heap, it refers ordinarily
to newly allocated storage. However, applications may opt to return a
pointer to shared storage provided the operator and the corresponding
.BR cru_destructor
function implement thread-safe reference
counting.
.SH ERRORS
If a quaternary operator sets the error code to any non-zero value, the
.BR cru_composed
function invoking it reclaims the graph passed to it, returns an empty
graph, and propagates the same error code to its caller.
.P
Applications can report POSIX error codes or define special purpose
codes, but should not redefine any that clash with those
reserved by
.BR cru
as declared in the
.I error_codes.h
header file.
.SH NOTES
Quartenary operators are passed via pointers to them in the
.BR qop
field in a
.BR cru_cqop
(conditional quarternary operator)
structure, which is built into the
.BR labeler
field in a
.BR cru_composer
structure passed to
.BR cru_composed.
The vertex properties contributing to the operator's input
are computed according to the local and adjacent props defined in the
.BR co_props
field of the
.BR cru_composer.
Each vertex can have two properties, one given by each prop, and the
appropriate property is selected depending on its role as the local or
the adjacent vertex in any given invocation.
