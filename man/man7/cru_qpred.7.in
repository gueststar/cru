.TH CRU_QPRED 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_qpred \- quaternary predicate type used in the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef int (*
.BR cru_qpred
)(void *, void *, void *, void *, int *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
A user-defined quaternary predicate indicates the sites in a graph
where a new edge should be created in the course of a
composition operation performed by the
.BR cru_composed
API function. The predicate
is called once for every combination of pairs of end-to-end edges in the
graph passed to
.BR cru_composed.
Its decision can depend in
general on
.TP
*
a user-defined property of the local vertex
.TP
*
a user-defined property of an adjacent vertex
.TP
*
the label of an edge originating from the local vertex
.TP
*
the label of an edge originating from the adjacent vertex.
.P
The four operands to the predicte correspond to these
entities in this order, and can be scalar values, pointers to heap
allocated storage, or a combination depending on the application's way
of representing a graph and its properties. The last parameter is a
pointer to an error code initially zero on entry. The operator must
treat the operands as read only but may assign the error code.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Any non-zero return value requests the creation of a composing edge
corresponding to the given combination of edges using an edge label
constructed by an associated
.BR cru_qop
function given the same arguments.
A return value of zero requests that no edge be created at that site.
.SH ERRORS
If a quaternary predicate sets the error code to any non-zero value, the
.BR cru_composed
function invoking it reclaims the graph passed to it, returns an empty
graph, and propagates the same error code to its caller.
.P
Applications can report POSIX error codes or define special purpose
codes, but should not redefine any that clash with those
reserved by
.BR cru
as declared in the
.I error_codes.h
header file.
.SH NOTES
Quartenary predicates are passed via pointers to them in the
.BR qpred
field in a
.BR cru_cqop
(conditional quarternary operator)
structure, which is built into the
.BR labeler
field in a
.BR cru_composer
structure passed to
.BR cru_composed.
The vertex properties contributing to the operator's input
are computed according to the local and adjacent props defined in the
.BR co_props
field of the
.BR cru_composer.
Each vertex can have two properties, one given by each prop, and the
appropriate property is selected depending on its role as the local or
the adjacent vertex in any given invocation.
.P
A quarternary predicate and a quarternary operator both referenced via
the same
.BR cru_cqop
structure should have identical operand types.
