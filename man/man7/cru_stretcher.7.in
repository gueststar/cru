.TH CRU_STRETCHER 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_stretcher \- specification for intermediate vertex creation
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_stretcher_s
.br
{
.br
int
.BR st_fix;
.br
.BR cru_tpred
.BR expander;
.br
struct
.BR cru_prop_s
.BR st_prop;
.br
} *
.BR cru_stretcher;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This structure parameterizes the
.BR cru_stretched
library function with necessary information initialized by the
application to expand a graph by interposing new vertices selectively
along the edges between existing vertices.
.TP
*
For each vertex in the graph, a property is computed
according to the
.BR st_prop
field by the usual
.BR cru_prop
calling conventions.
.TP
*
For each edge in the graph, the
.BR expander
ternary predicate is passed the edge's label as its middle operand and
the properties of the edge's origin and terminus as its left and right
operands, respectively.
.TP
*
For each call to the
.BR cru_stretch
library function the predicate makes before returning, a new vertex
is inserted between the origin and the terminus and connected to them by two
new edges with labels given by the parameters passed to
.BR cru_stretch.
.TP
*
If the predicate returns a non-zero value, the edge whose label it is passed
is deleted.
.TP
*
If the
.BR st_fix
field is non-zero, then this process is iterated across the graph
until the ternary predicate declines to create any new vertices or
until the graph's designated vertex limit is reached.
.P
The vertex reduction operator in the
.BR st_prop
field is not needed and may be omitted or initialized to
NULL.
.SH ERRORS
These errors might be reported by the
.BR cru_stretched
function for the reasons indicated.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDEXP
No function is defined in the
.BR expander
field.
.TP
.BR CRU_INTOVF
A vertex limit previously associated with the graph during its creation
is reached or exceeded due to the creation of more vertices.
.SH NOTES
The vertex limit in a graph is set according to the
.BR cru_sig
structure used to build or modify it.
