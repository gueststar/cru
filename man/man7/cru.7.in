.TH CRU 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru \- co-recursion utilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR cru
is a C library for high-performance, high-level operations on memory
resident graphs, with possible applications to model checking, finite
element analysis, and financial derivatives valuation among other
things. The library is designed with robust memory management to
handle graphs typically on the order of millions to tens of millions
of vertices, and allows the flexibility of graph vertices and edge
labels being scalar values or pointers to dynamic storage as the
application requires.
.P
Everything
.BR cru
does is concurrent with configurably many threads and with all
necessary thread synchronization managed automatically. Some things
possible with
.BR cru
are:
.TP
*
building a gigantic graph from a seed by simple production rules
with duplicate vertices automatically pruned
.TP
*
traversing a graph depth first, breadth first, backwards, forwards, or
in order of best concurrency to compute any metrics about it
.TP
*
classifying, clustering, and collecting graph
vertices by arbitrary criteria
.TP
*
inserting, transplanting, overwriting, or removing edges and
vertices at multiple sites in a graph according to user-defined
rewrite rules depending on local conditions
.TP
*
non-destructively deep-copying or sharing a graph
.TP
*
forming a product of two graphs by some definition
