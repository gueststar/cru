.SH DESCRIPTION
With each field in a
.BR cru_fold
structure pointing to a user-defined function of the indicated
type, applications pass it to various
.BR cru
library functions that use it to compute a user-defined result from
a set of arbitrarily many edge labels, vertices, or properties in a
graph.
.P
There are two main ways of organizing the computation. The simpler
way starts with the
.BR map
or the
.BR bmap
function being applied to every member of the set of operands. Then
the
.BR reduction
is applied to pairs of result values returned by it
if there are more than one, which are discarded afterwards. Then the
.BR reduction
is further applied to pairs of results obtained by previous reductions
if any, which are also discarded. Sufficiently many reductions are
evaluated with intermediate results discarded until only a single
result remains.
.P
In the other way of organizing the computation, the
.BR map
or
.BR bmap
is also applied initially to every member of the set, and in addition, the
.BR vacuous_case
is evaluated. If there are any operands in the set, the
.BR reduction
is then applied to the pair of a
.BR map
result as its left operand and the
.BR vacuous_case
result as its right, both of which are discarded.
While any unused
results remain, the
.BR reduction
is evaluated with one of them as its left operand
and the previous
.BR reduction
result as its right, both of which are discarded.
The result overall is that of the
.BR vacuous_case
if the set of operands is empty, or the last
.BR reduction
evaluated otherwise.
.P
Applications select the simpler way by initializing the
.BR vacuous_case
field to
NULL
and the other way by initializing it as a pointer to a user-defined
nullary operator. Some differences necessarily follow.
.TP
*
The simpler way is defined only for non-empty sets of operands.
.TP
*
The simpler way requires the results of the
.BR map
and the
.BR reduction
to have identical types.
.TP
*
The simpler way requires both operands of the
.BR reduction
to have the same type as its result.
.P
In the alternative:
.TP
* 
The result overall for any empty set of operands is given by the
.BR vacuous_case.
.TP
*
The
.BR reduction
and the
.BR vacuous_case
must have identical result types.
.TP
*
Only the right operand of the
.BR reduction
must match its result type.
.TP
*
The
.BR map
or
.BR bmap
can have any result type, but the left operand type of the
.BR reduction
must match it.
.P
In either case, functions given by the two destructor fields reclaim
the discarded intermediate results. The
.BR r_free
function reclaims results returned by the
.BR reduction,
and the
.BR m_free
function reclaims results returned by the
.BR map
or
.BR bmap.
These destructors must be suitable for their operand types. Either or
both of these fields can be set to
NULL,
in which case
.BR cru
infers that the corresponding result type is a scalar in no need of
reclamation. Some other inferences are then possible:
.TP
*
If all of the
.BR m_free,
.BR map
and
.BR bmap
fields are
NULL,
then
.BR cru
may infer a default
.BR map
operator that unconditionally returns its middle operand.
.TP
*
If both the
.BR r_free
and the
.BR reduction
fields are
NULL,
then
.BR cru
infers a default
.BR reduction
operator that returns the lesser of its two operands
cast as unsigned integers.
.P
At most one
.BR map
or
.BR bmap
function may be defined in any
.BR cru_fold.
The
.BR bmap,
being a
.BR cru_bop,
is expected to take
only two operands and an error code as arguments,
whereas the
.BR map,
being a
.BR cru_top,
is expected to take three operands and an error code.
If a
.BR bmap
is defined, it is passed only the left and middle operands
that would have been passed to a
.BR map.
.SH ERRORS
It is an error to omit a destructor when the corresponding result is
dynamically allocated. This error is not detectable by
.BR cru
but may cause memory leaks. Other errors are reportable by whatever
API function is being called under these circumstances:
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDVAC
Evaluation is requested on an empty set of operands but no
.BR vacuous_case
is defined.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDMAP
A
.BR map
operator is required but not specified or inferrable.
.TP
.BR CRU_UNDRED
A
.BR reduction
operator is required but not specified or inferrable.
.TP
.BR CRU_TPCMPR
No
.BR vacuous_case
is specified but the destructors differ,
indicating that the
.BR map
and
.BR reduction
result types are incompatible.
If the
.BR cru_fold
structure is the
.BR vertex
field of a
.BR cru_prop
structure belonging to a
.BR cru_mapreducer
top level structure,
then this error is reported whenever the destructors differ,
with or without a
.BR vacuous_case
defined.
.P
If neither destructor is specified because both result types are scalars,
type conflicts are still an error but are not detected.
.SH NOTES
Applications should ensure that the vacuous case result is
semantically appropriate for the reduction. For example, the sum of an
empty set of numbers is zero, the product of an empty set of numbers
is conventionally taken to be unity, etcetera.
.P
There is no specified ordering among the operands to a reduction.
Applications relying on stronger assumptions will likely fail
intermittently or be broken completely by an eventual update to
.BR cru.
To ensure deterministic results, the
.BR reduction
.BR r
must satisfy
.BR r
(
.BR x,
.BR r
(
.BR y,
.BR z)\~)
=
.BR r
(
.BR y,
.BR r
(
.BR x,
.BR z)\~)
for
.BR map
results
.BR x
and
.BR y
if there is a
.BR vacuous_case
defined, or must be associative and commutative otherwise.
.P
The
.BR cru_fold
structure is part of the
.BR cru_prop
and
.BR cru_kernel
derived structures,
and the
.BR cru_inducer
top level structure. Defining a
.BR bmap
instead of a
.BR map
is useful when an application requires a vertex mutation to depend on
the incident or outgoing edges of the vertices, but it is prohibited
from depending on adjacent vertices because the graph is cyclic and
the traversal order therefore must be unconstrained. When the
.BR cru_fold
in the
.BR incident
or
.BR outgoing
field in a
.BR cru_prop
specifies a
.BR bmap
instead of a
.BR map,
and the
.BR cru_prop
is the
.BR v_op
field in a
.BR cru_kernel
that is the
.BR mu_kernel
field in a
.BR cru_mutator,
the
.BR bmap
function's operands are the mutable vertex and the edge label,
but not the adjacent vertex.
.SH EXAMPLE
Given two user-defined functions as shown,
.nf
   uintptr_t
   sum (uintptr_t l, uintptr_t r, int *err)
   {
      return (l + r);
   }

   uintptr_t
   square (uintptr_t l, uintptr_t m, uintptr_t r, int *err)
   {
      return (m * m);
   }
.fi
this example declares the structure
.BR sum_of_squares
of type
.I struct
.BR cru_fold_s
to specify the computation of the sum of the squares of a non-empty
set of numbers.
.nf
   struct cru_fold_s sum_of_squares = {
      .reduction = (cru_bop) sum,
      .map = (cru_top) square};
