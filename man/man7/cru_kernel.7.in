.SH NAME
cru_kernel \- a pair of related operations on vertices and edges
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>

typedef struct
.BR cru_kernel_s
.br
{

} *
.BR cru_kernel;
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR cru_kernel
structure specifies a related pair of user-defined operations, one for
vertices and one for edges, to be passed by applications to
.BR cru
library functions that use them when visiting the site of each vertex
in a graph. The
.BR v_op
field holds the vertex operation specification, and the
.BR e_op
field holds that of the edges.
.TP
*
The vertex operation is allowed to depend on
the vertex, its incident and outgoing edge labels, and its adjacent vertices
by the usual calling conventions of a
.BR cru_prop.
.TP
*
The edge operation is allowed to depend on the label of an edge
and on the vertices at either end. The function referenced by the
.BR e_op.map
field is called the edge label as the
middle operand, the vertex currently being visited as its left operand,
and the adjacent vertex as its right operand.
.P
The latter point implies that when operating on an outgoing edge from a vertex
being visited, the
.BR e_op.map
function has the edge's origin as its left operand and the terminus as its right
operand. When operating on an incoming edge to a vertex being visited, the
left operand is the terminus of the edge and the right operand is its origin.
.P
When the 
.BR cru_kernel
structure is a field in a
.BR cru_mutator
or a
.BR cru_filter
structure, no function is required for the
.BR v_op.vertex.reduction.
All reduction functions are required when the
.BR cru_kernel
is a field in a
.BR cru_merger.
