.SH NAME
cru_ctop_quad \- quadruple of conditional ternary operators
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_ctop_quad_s
.br
{
.br
struct
.BR cru_ctop_pair_s
.BR inward;
.br
struct
.BR cru_ctop_pair_s
.BR outward;
.br
} *
.BR cru_ctop_quad;
.SH DESCRIPTION
Applications initialize this structure to inform the creation or modification
of edge labels in the course of a splitting operation performed by the
.BR cru_split
library function. The
.BR inward
field specifies the labels on the incoming edges to vertices created
by splitting, and the
.BR outward
field specifies the labels on their outgoing edges, both according to
the usual calling conventions for
.BR cru_ctop_pair
structures.
.SH NOTES
The
.BR cru_ctop_quad
structure is part of the
.BR cru_splitter
top level structure.
