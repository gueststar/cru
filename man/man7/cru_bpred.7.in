.TH CRU_BPRED 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_bpred \- binary predicate type used in the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef int (*
.BR cru_bpred
)(void *, void *, int *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
A user-defined binary predicate takes a pair of operands and a pointer
to an initially zero error code as arguments. The operands can be
scalar values, pointers to heap allocated storage, or a combination.
The operator must treat the operands as read only but may assign the
error code.
.P
Binary predicates model mathematical relations and are used as
decision procedures in various contexts. See the NOTES for details.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Viewed as a relation, a binary predicate returns zero if
its operands are unrelated and a non-zero value if they are related.
.SH ERRORS
If a binary predicate sets the error code to any non-zero value, the
.BR cru
API function invoking it terminates early without completing, and
propagates the same error code to its caller.
.P
Applications can report POSIX error codes or define special purpose
codes, but should not redefine any that clash with those
reserved by
.BR cru
as declared in the
.I error_codes.h
header file.
.SH NOTES
Applications pass binary predicates to
.BR cru
as pointers through
.TP
*
the
.BR bpred
field in a
.BR cru_cbop
(conditional binary operator) structure
.TP
*
the
.BR fissile
field in a
.BR cru_splitter
top level structure
.TP
*
and the
.BR equal
field in a
.BR cru_order,
which can belong to a
.BR cru_order_pair,
a
.BR cru_classifier,
or a
.BR cru_filter.
.P
A conditional binary operator can be the
.BR postponement
field in a
.BR cru_postponer
or the
.BR e_prod
field in a
.BR cru_crosser.
.TP
*
In a
.BR cru_postponer
the predicate selects postponable edges for postponement by returning
a non-zero value given and postponable edge label as its left operand
the sibling as its right, but zero otherwise.
.TP
*
In a
.BR cru_crosser
the predicate takes the labels of two edges each from a vertex in one
of the graphs to be crossed, and returns non-zero only if a combined
edge corresponding to them should be created in the resulting graph.
