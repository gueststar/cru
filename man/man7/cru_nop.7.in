.TH CRU_NOP 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_nop \- nullary operator function type used in the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef void* (*
.BR cru_nop
)(int *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
A user-defined nullary operator takes only a pointer to an initially
zero error code as an argument and returns a constant value.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The operator may return either a scalar value or a pointer to the
heap.
.TP
*
In the case of a scalar value, the result is required to be
identical on every invocation.
.TP
*
In the case of a pointer, the result ordinarily should be a pointer
to a newly allocated copy of an identical result on every invocation.
.TP
* 
Alternatively, applications may opt to return a pointer to a shared
copy of the result. In that case both the operator and the
corresponding
.BR cru_destructor
function are responsible for implementing thread-safe reference
counting.
.SH ERRORS
If a nullary operator sets the error code to any non-zero value, the
.BR cru
API function invoking it terminates early without completing, and
propagates the same error code to its caller.
.P
Applications can report POSIX error codes or define special purpose
codes, but should not redefine any that clash with those
reserved by
.BR cru
as declared in the
.I error_codes.h
header file.
.SH NOTES
Applications pass nullary operators to
.BR cru
through the
.BR vacuous_case
field in a
.BR cru_fold
structure as an optional way of defining the effect of folding over an empty
set. The result is application-specific. For example, the sum of an
empty set of numbers would be zero, whereas the product of an empty set
of numbers is conventionally taken to be unity.
