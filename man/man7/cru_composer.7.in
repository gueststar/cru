.SH DESCRIPTION
This structure parameterizes the
.BR cru_composed
library function with necessary information initialized by the
application to create new edges in a graph determined by
end-to-end pairs of existing edges. The fields have these interpretations.
.TP
*
The structure in the
.BR co_props
field is used to compute two arbitrarily user-defined properties
associated with each vertex in a given graph, one designated as its
local and the other as its adjacent property, according to usual
conventions for
.BR cru_prop_pair
structures.
.TP
*
For every outgoing edge from every vertex to an adjacent vertex, and
for every outgoing edge from the adjacent vertex, the quarternary
predicate in the
.BR labeler.qpred
field is passed the local property of the vertex as its first operand,
the adjacent property of the adjacent vertex as its second operand,
the label on the incident edge to the adjacent vertex as its next
operand, and the label on the outgoing edge from the adjacent vertex
its last operand.
.TP
*
If the predicate referenced by the
.BR labeler.qpred
field returns a non-zero value, then the same operands in the same
order are passed to the quarternary operator referenced by the
.BR labeler.qop
field, which is expected to return the label of a new edge to be
included in the graph. The new edge is made to connect the vertex
whose local property is given as the first parameter directly to the
terminus of the edge whose label is given as the last parameter.
.TP
*
If the
.BR destructive
field is non-zero, then the incident edge to the adjacent vertex is deleted
from the graph. The outgoing edge from it is retained regardless.
.TP
*
If the
.BR co_fix
field is non-zero, then this procedure is iterated in multiple passes
over the graph until the predicate calls for the creation of no
further edges.
.P
The
.BR labeler.qpred
field may be omitted or initialized as
NULL,
in which case the
.BR label.qop
function is invoked unconditionally. If the composition pertains to a graph whose
edge labels are scalar values, then the
.BR label.qop
field also may be omitted or initialized as
NULL.
In that case, the created edge is labeled identically to the incident edge.
