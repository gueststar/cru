.TH CRU_CTOP 7 @DATE_VERSION_TITLE@
.SH NAME
cru_ctop \- conditional ternary operator for the cru library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <cru/cru.h>
.sp
typedef struct
.BR cru_ctop_s
.br
{
.br
.BR cru_tpred
.BR tpred;
.br
.BR cru_top
.BR top;
.br
} *
.BR cru_ctop;
.SH DESCRIPTION
A conditional ternary operator represents a ternary operator whose
result is required only if some predicate is true of its operands.
When conditional operators are passed to
.BR cru
library functions, they are used only as follows:
.TP
*
First the predicate is applied to the operands.
.TP
*
If the predicate returns any non-zero value, then a result is
obtained from the operator applied to those same operands.
.TP
*
If the predicate returns zero, the operator is not invoked and
therefore not required to produce any valid result.
.P
A
NULL
.BR tpred
field causes the operator to be invoked unconditionally.
.SH ERRORS
The
.BR top
field defaults to an operator that returns a copy of its middle
operand if left unspecified, but only when used to operate on a graph
whose edge labels are scalar values. Otherwise, it must be initialized
to something other than
NULL
to prevent an error of
.BR CRU_UNDCTO
from being reported for an undefined conditional ternary operator.
.SH NOTES
Conditional ternary operators form the
.BR cru_ctop_pair
structures built into the
.BR sp_ctops
field of a
.BR cru_splitter
used in splitting operations. The middle operand is an edge label and
the first and last are properties of the edge's originating and
terminal vertices, respectively. The properties are computed according to
the
.BR cru_prop
structure built into the
.BR sp_prop
field of the same splitter.
